NFL Player Performance and Earnings Analyzer: A Reference Tool
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the NFL Player Performance and Earnings Analyzer. This console application, once a fully operational tool, was designed to scrape data from two separate websites: one for NFL players' statistics and another for their salary information. By compiling and analyzing this data, the application provided insights into players' earnings relative to their on-field performances, including calculations like earnings per year, per pass attempt, and per touchdown, among others. Although the tool is now deprecated due to changes in the source websites' schemas, it remains a valuable reference for developers and analysts interested in sports data analysis.

Application Overview:
